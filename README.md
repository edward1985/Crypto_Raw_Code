# Crypto_Raw_Code

We need to stay away from IOS, because it stops the compatibility from other system.

Openssl is too complicated and too fuzy for us to be compatible.

This Project will implement AES/BASE64/SHA/RSA using simple, direct , high efficient, full tested, and with useful examples.

Our object is: Become a independent API for Crypto

   The efficient is the best.
   Every part is independent and easy to select and use it.
   Easy to communicate with others.


Welcome any people to contribute your talent.
  Staying away from the people using ruby, Stay away from the people using too much complicated object related so called technic
  Staying away from the people who talk in a so called graceful ways.
